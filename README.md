# Neural_Network
This project is an interactive neural network simulator built with Streamlit.
“Should Shobhit go on a Goa trip?
This app answers that using a tiny neural network you can explore interactively.
Built using Streamlit and Graphviz, the dashboard lets users:

adjust input factors: Weather, Budget, Free Time, Mood

tune the importance (weights) of each factor

view a real-time updated network diagram

see the computed weighted sum

compare it with a decision threshold

get the final decision (“Go” or “Don’t Go”)

This project is designed for demonstrations, teaching neural networks, and showing how inputs, weights, and thresholds together influence a final decision.”
